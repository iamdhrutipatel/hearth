<strong>lovenest</strong> is a self-hosted personal and household finance hub — a friendly downstream fork of <a href="https://github.com/securo-finance/securo">Securo</a>. It runs entirely on your own infrastructure, giving you and your household full visibility into accounts, spending, and habits without surrendering your financial data to third parties. lovenest tracks upstream Securo closely and layers on a few deployment and login customizations on top.

## Attribution

**lovenest is built on [Securo](https://github.com/securo-finance/securo), licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE).**

The core application — every feature listed below — is the work of the Securo project and its contributors. lovenest is a thin **customization and deployment layer** on top of that work: it does not reimplement the app, and it does not claim Securo's features as its own. Upstream copyright and the AGPL-3.0 license are preserved in full (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

If you want the canonical project, its docs, demo, and community, go to **[Securo](https://github.com/securo-finance/securo)** ([website](https://usesecuro.com/) · [roadmap](https://www.usesecuro.com/roadmap) · [docs](https://docs.usesecuro.com/) · [demo](https://demo.usesecuro.com/)).

## What lovenest adds

On top of upstream Securo, this fork contributes:

- **OIDC-primary login layout** — surfaces single-sign-on as the primary path on the login screen, suited to households running their own identity provider (Authentik, Pocket ID, etc.).
- **Google OIDC `at_hash` sign-in fix** — accepts Google-issued `id_token`s that carry an `at_hash` claim, fixing a sign-in failure with Google as the OIDC provider. *(Contributed upstream as Securo PR #350.)*
- **SimpleFIN credit-card balance-sign normalization** — normalizes the balance sign for credit-card accounts synced via SimpleFIN so balances read correctly. *(Contributed upstream as Securo PR #351.)*
- **Built-from-source deployment** — runs the production stack built locally from this repository rather than from prebuilt upstream images (see [Quickstart](#quickstart)).

The two sign-in / sync fixes above were submitted back to Securo as pull requests #350 and #351, so they may already be present in upstream releases.

## Quickstart

lovenest builds the production stack from source in this repository:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Environment configuration lives in `.env` — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values (`SECRET_KEY`, optional bank-sync and OIDC settings, etc.) before bringing the stack up.

Balances, budgets, due dates, and recurring transactions use the application timezone configured in **Admin Settings → Date and time**. Each workspace can override it in **Workspace settings**. Without a saved setting, the application uses `TZ`, then the host timezone, then UTC.

## Branch model

- **`main`** mirrors upstream Securo.
- **`lovenest`** is the working and default branch, carrying the lovenest customizations described above.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development workflow.

## Features (Securo)

The following is **Securo's feature set**, inherited unchanged by lovenest:

- Multi-account management with running balances
- Transaction management with search, filters, and CSV export
- File import (OFX, QIF, CAMT, CSV) and an auto-categorization rules engine
- Recurring transactions, budgets, and savings goals with progress tracking
- Asset management with valuation tracking and growth rules
- Reports: Net Worth, Income vs Expenses, and cashflow
- Bank sync via providers: **Pluggy** (Brazilian banks), **Enable Banking** (~2500 European PSD2 banks), **SimpleFIN** (US and international banks), and **Coinbase** (crypto balances and trade history, read-only API key) — extensible
- Multi-currency support with automatic FX conversion
- Multi-user support with an admin panel and registration controls
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP) with brute-force protection, plus passkey support
- OIDC login for Authentik, Pocket ID, and other standard providers, including OIDC-only deployments
- AI Agents (optional): self-hosted LLM chat with tool-use over your data, plus a per-agent RAG knowledge base

For provider setup (Pluggy, Enable Banking, SimpleFIN), OIDC configuration, exchange rates, and AI Agents, follow **[Securo's documentation](https://docs.usesecuro.com/)** — the underlying configuration keys are unchanged in this fork.

## AI-Assisted Development

Parts of this codebase were built with help of AI. All code is human-reviewed and no data leaves your environment.

Contributing with AI is welcome. We review the author, not the tool: whatever wrote the diff, you own its quality, its fit with where lovenest is going, and everything that happens after it merges. See [Using AI](CONTRIBUTING.md#using-ai).

## Development

```bash
# Run backend tests with the Python version in backend/.python-version
cd backend
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run --no-sync pytest

# Rebuild after dependency changes
docker compose up --build
```

The backend installs editably into `.venv`; after changing dependencies, run
`backend/scripts/lock.sh` and commit `backend/uv.lock`. See
[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-checks-ci-runs) for the full checks and
[tax planner development](extras/tax/README.md) for its separate uv project.

If you've [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) installed, you can install backend/frontend directly with it:

```
# Install the Python version specified in .python-version,
# and create a project virtual environment using that Python.
# Install all tools and dependencies (include Python with dedicated venv)
mise //...:install

# Install only backend tools/deps
mise backend:install

# Run backend tests
mise backend:test

# Install frontend dependencies
mise frontend:install

# Run frontend linting
mise frontend:lint

# Run frontend build
mise frontend:build
```
